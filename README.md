# Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Club



## Use Case

A client approached me who is starting up their own Brazilian Jit-Jitsu (BJJ) club in the local area. They feel that a website will be invaluable to their business for finding new students, and keeping existing students up to date with timetables and any other club related updates
