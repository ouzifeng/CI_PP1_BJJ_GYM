# Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Club



### Use Case

A client approached me who is starting up their own Brazilian Jit-Jitsu (BJJ) club in the local area. They feel that a website will be invaluable to their business for finding new students, and keeping existing students up to date with timetables and any other club related updates

## Project Scope

### End User Requirements

* Need to know prices
* Need to know lesson schedule

### Customer Goals

* Find new students

## User Experience

### Target Audience

* Potential students who are new to the sport and looking to join a gym for the first time
* Students who are already training but are looking for a new gym closer to their existing one
* Parents who want their children to try a new sport

## UX/UI

## Design

### Fonts

For the font choice we needed something which looked professional but also welcoming and friendly.

* Montserrat for headings
* Lato for body

### Colour Scheme

Based on how the leading gyms have built their colour schemes:
 * https://rogergracie.com/
 * https://ekbjj.com/ 
 * https://www.bjjlondon.com/
 * https://www.10thplanetjj.com/

 They are clean with plenty of constrasting colours - namely white with black.

To keep with this theme, but with a lisght twist the 2 main colours will be baby powder and rich black, coupled with a choice of bolder colours for CTAs
